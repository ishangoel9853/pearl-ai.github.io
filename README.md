PEARL is an open source DIY platform for understanding Reinforcement Learning. You learn at your own pace, through chapterwise slideshows, and then test your understanding on the corresponding coding assignments.

Slideshows are meant to provide better intuitions, using illustrations.

Feel free to raise issues or contribute to the course content. We continuously strive to improve the understandability and simplicity of the content, while keeping the completeness and intuitiveness of the foundational concepts.
